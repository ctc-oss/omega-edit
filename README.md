## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide an open source library for building editors that can handle massive files,
multiple authors, and multiple viewports.

## User documentation

User documentation is published to https://ctc-oss.github.io/omega-edit/.

## Requirements

### IDE

The Ωedit project is built primarily using CLion.  If using CLion everything should build seamlessly, though Visual
Studio Code also works well.

### Command line tools

- **C/C++ compiler** (such as clang, gcc, mingw, or MSVC)
- **CMake** (https://cmake.org/download/)
- **conan** C/C++ package manager
- **make** or **ninja** for running the build scripts
- **nvm** or **nodeenv** for using specific versions of node.js
- **doxygen** to generate API documentation (https://www.doxygen.nl)
- **sphinx** to generate user documentation (https://www.sphinx-doc.org)
  - **sphinx RTD theme** (https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme)
  - **breathe** ReStructuredText and Sphinx bridge to Doxygen (https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe)
- **scala/sbt/java**

## Build the core library (C/C++)

:exclamation: These commands should be executed at the root level of the repository :exclamation:

### Install conan:

```bash
pip install conan
```

### Configure a debug build:

Depending on your linking needs, Ωedit can be built as either as a static (e.g., libomega_edit.a) or shared (e.g., libomega_edit.so) library.

- #### Static:

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

- #### Shared:

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=YES
```

### Build the configured build:

```bash
cmake --build cmake-build-debug
```

### Run the test suite:

```bash
cmake -S src/tests -B cmake-build-tests -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
pushd cmake-build-tests && ctest -C Debug --output-on-failure && popd
```

## Packaging Ωedit

### TypeScript Client

This package is normally uploaded to npmjs.com

:exclamation: Node needs to be installed but shouldn't matter what version you use. :exclamation:

- Create local `.tgz` file

  ```bash
  cd src/rpc/client/ts
  yarn install # if not ran before
  yarn package
  ```

  - File will be at

    ```bash
    src/rpc/client/ts/omega-edit-v${VERSION}.tgz
    ```

- Publish `.tgz` file to npmjs -- requires auth

  ```bash
  yarn publish omega-edit-v${VERSION}.tgz
  ```

### Scala API and Native

This publishes for both Scala version 2.12 and 2.13 to GitHub packages.

- Requires the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to be set

```bash
sbt publishAll
```

### Scala Reference Server

This packages the reference Scala server to a local zip folder

```bash
cd src/rpc/server/scala
sbt universial:packageBin
```

Zip file will be located at

```bash
src/rpc/server/scala/target/universal/example-grpc-server-${VERSION}.zip
```

## Development

Currently, the repo holds bindings for both java and node.

## Versioning

Ωedit follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
