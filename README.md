# Î©mega Edit Library
The goal of this project is to provide an open source library for building editors that can handle massive files, multiple authors, and multiple viewports.

## Requirements
This repo is built using CLion, if using CLion everything will work seamlessly, though Visual Studio Code also works well. (cmake)

If you are using just the command line you will need these things installed:
- C++ Compiler
- CMake (https://cmake.org/download/)
- NodeJS 10
- Swig

## cmake commands
:exclamation: These commands should be built at root level of the repo :exclamation:

Run Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug
```

Run Debug
```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_DEPENDS_USE_COMPILER=FALSE \
  -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" .
```

Build omega_test
```bash
cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target omega_test -- -j 6
```

Run tests
```bash
cd cmake-build-debug/tests/
./omega_test -d yes --order lex
cd ../../
```

## swig
Build wrapper classes
```bash
swig -javascript -node -v -c++ -outdir src/bindings/javascript src/bindings/omega_edit.i
```

## node-gyp
:exclamation: run `yarn install` before trying to run other commands :exclamation:

Configure
```
yarn run gyp-configure
```

Build
```
yarn run gyp-build
```

## run script
