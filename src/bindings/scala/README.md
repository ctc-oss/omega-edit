立edit Scala API
===

Scala interface to the 立edit library.

## Design

Trait based API hides the native FFI implementation details.  The traits allow for flexible unit testing, mocking, and changes to the FFI provider (JNR-FFI).

The entry point to the system is via the `com.ctc.omega_edit.api.OmegaEdit` object which provides factory interface for 立edit `Session`s.

The `com.ctc.omega_edit.api` package provides the public interface, while the `com.ctc.omega_edit` package contains the private implementation details.

See the 立edit documentation for details on the native API design philosophy and goals.

## Installation

**Note** there are no public artifacts published at this time, the installation from source tree below is the suggested method for installation.

Artifacts will be available from public repositories in a future revision of this library.

Artifacts use Maven rather than Ivy to better support the use of the classifier to identify the native platform.

### install from source tree

Running `sbt install` from the root directory of this project will install the artifacts into the local Maven cache.

To use these artifacts from SBT you must add the M2 local resolver:

`resolvers += Resolver.mavenLocal`

### sbt dependency

Artifacts are being built for Scala `2.12` and `2.13`.

The native binaries are delivered via artifacts that use a classifier to indicate the platform they target.

There is no explicit dependency from the api to the native library, so that dependency must be specified by the client.

```
val omegaEditVersion = "0.7.0-58-gbcb712d"
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "com.ctc" %% s"omega-edit" % omegaEditVersion,
    "com.ctc" %% s"omega-edit-native" % omegaEditVersion classifier linux-64
)
```

The classifier controls identifies the platform binaries to match the runtime.

Platform identifiers are as follows

- `linux-{32|64}`
- `macos-{32|64}`
- `windows-{32|64}`

## callbacks

Callbacks can be passed in may ways including function objects, anonymous functions, and even closures.

It is important to be aware that if you do not maintain a reference the callback it will be garbage collected.
The API does not do this, it is the clients responsibiliity to maintain a reference to the callback.

See the [JNR-FFI Callback documentation](https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi/blob/master/docs/TypeMappings.md#callbackfunction-types) for more information.

## Future
- consider separating the JNR-FFI support into a separate submodule to allow parallel binding support or other backends (e.g. JNA or JavaCPP)
- find or create a generator from native header files (`.h`, `.hpp`) to JNR-FFI bindings trait.
- SBT plugin that detects and sets the classifier and installs the local resolver
