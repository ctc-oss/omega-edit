/**
 * At the heart of Omega Edit, is the file editing session (session_t) which manages everything concerning the editing
 * of a given file.  Once a session is created, it needs to have one or more authors (author_t).  Each author can create
 * a series of changes (change_t) and can have a series of viewports (viewport_t).  Any changes that affect viewports in
 * the associated session will be kept up-to-date and when a viewport is changed, a user-defined callback function will
 * be called with the updated viewport and the change that triggered the update.
